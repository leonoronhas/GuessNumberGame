# GuessNumberGame
Guess Number Game App made with React Native

A simple game where the user inputs a number from 0 to 99 and the CPU/Phone tries to guess it.
There is a hint process where you need to help the cpu find the correct number providing a "+" or "-" hint based on the number provided previously.
If an attempt to trick the cpu is made, an alert is displayed to make sure a fair game is being played. 

After a correct guess is made, a game over screen summarizes the game and the number of rounds it took the cpu to get it right.
